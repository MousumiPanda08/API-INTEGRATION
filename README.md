**DESCRIPTION** 

As part of Task-1 for my Full Stack Web Development internship at CODTECH IT Solutions, I was assigned the responsibility to build a project that demonstrates API integration. After researching a variety of free and public APIs, I selected the Open-Meteo API. This API stood out because it offers both weather forecasting and geocoding services, does not require any API key, and supports global coverage. These features made it ideal for building a real-time, location-based weather web application.

I developed a Weather Web App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose of the application is to allow users to input the name of any city in the world and instantly receive current weather details such as temperature, wind speed, and weather conditions. When a user enters a city name into the input field and clicks the button, the application performs two main API requests. First, it uses Open-Meteo’s Geocoding API to convert the city name into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude). Then, using these coordinates, it calls the Weather Forecast API to retrieve the current weather data for that location.

To enhance the usability and make the app visually appealing, I implemented a system that maps Open-Meteo’s weather condition codes to corresponding weather icons. This allows users to easily interpret the current conditions at a glance. I also integrated flagcdn.com, which lets the app display the national flag of the country where the city is located, adding an additional visual layer and making the information more recognizable.

On the design side, I aimed to create a clean, modern, and responsive user interface. The app uses a gradient background to create visual depth and displays results in card-style components. Interactive elements like buttons and input fields are styled using CSS to provide a smooth and engaging user experience. The layout is also responsive, making it accessible across both desktop and mobile devices.

This weather app serves several practical, everyday purposes. For instance, users can check current weather before going out, while traveling, or when planning events. It’s particularly useful for international students, travelers, and remote workers who want to know the weather in another part of the world. A student planning to study abroad could monitor weather conditions in their future city, while someone working with a global team could quickly check the weather in a colleague’s location. It also holds value in educational settings, such as classrooms where teachers can use it as a tool to introduce concepts in geography and climate science.

I hosted this application using Netlify, a free and developer-friendly cloud platform that enabled me to deploy static websites with ease. With Netlify, I was able to drag and drop my project folder or connect a GitHub repository and instantly generate a shareable live URL. This simplified the deployment process and allowed me to make my application publicly accessible without needing to set up or manage any server.

**CONCLUSION**

This project allowed me to translate classroom learning into a practical, real-world application. It helped me understand how frontend technologies interact with third-party APIs, how to handle asynchronous data using the fetch API, and how to structure and display dynamic content on a webpage. By working with JSON responses and integrating external resources like flag icons, I gained experience in data processing and DOM manipulation.

The design phase strengthened my skills in writing responsive and user-friendly CSS. Hosting the project on Netlify gave me experience in modern frontend deployment strategies and taught me how to publish a static web application without relying on backend servers or paid infrastructure.
