*DESCRIPTION* 

As part of Task-1 for my Full Stack Web Development internship at CODTECH, I was given the responsibility to build a project that demonstrates API integration. After researching a few public APIs, I decided to use the Open-Meteo API because it is free, does not require any API key, and supports both weather forecasting and geocoding. This allowed me to create a web application that displays real-time weather information for any city across the world. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When a user enters a city name into the input field and clicks the button, the application first uses Open-Meteo's geocoding API to convert the city name into geographic coordinates. Then, those coordinates are used to fetch the current weather data such as temperature, wind speed, and weather condition codes from the weather API. To make the output more user-friendly and visually appealing, I implemented a mapping system that matches each weather code to a relevant weather icon, and I also integrated flagcdn.com to show the flag of the country where the city is located. I focused on creating a clean and responsive user interface using CSS. The design includes gradient backgrounds, card-style result displays, and interactive buttons to enhance the user experience. This weather web application has several day-to-day practical uses. People often check the weather before leaving home, planning travel, or making decisions about what to wear. Since this app supports city search across the globe, it can be useful not only for local users but also for travelers, students, and professionals working across different regions. For example, a student preparing to study abroad can use it to monitor weather conditions in their future city. Similarly, someone working remotely with a global team can quickly check the weather in another team member's location. The app also has potential for use in classrooms as an educational tool when teaching geography or climate awareness. The project helped me understand how frontend technologies interact with external services and how to process data fetched in real time. I learned how to use JavaScriptâ€™s fetch API for asynchronous operations, parse and use JSON data, and update the DOM dynamically to reflect live content. Styling the project with CSS also gave me better control over layout and responsiveness. Overall, this was a very meaningful project for me as it allowed me to take a real-world problem and solve it through programming. It also helped reinforce my understanding of API calls, data handling, error checking, and frontend design principles. Completing this task gave me more confidence in building independent projects using core web technologies. In the future, I plan to improve this application by adding new features such as a multi-day forecast, auto-location detection using the browser's geolocation API, and more detailed weather descriptions. I also plan to optimize the UI for mobile devices and consider integrating local storage so users can quickly revisit their last searched city. This project not only fulfilled the internship requirement of API integration but also gave me a valuable learning experience that I can build upon in more advanced full stack projects. Working on this application gave me a glimpse into how powerful APIs can be when integrated effectively, and how user experience plays a critical role in the usability of web applications.
